AUST is a website base project where it represents a website of a school. There are two separate logins  for students and admin.
Student can register and log into the account. They are allowed to add or drop a course. Admin can login also and add courses 
and teachers for the school. For database I have used Xampp/phpmyadmin phpMyAdmin which is a free 
and open source administration tool for MySQL and MariaDB.
